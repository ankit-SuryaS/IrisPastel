An organ donation static app developed using Bootstrap and deployed on Azure for Future Ready Talent Internship individual project by Ankit Datta.

People are allowed to donate organs, and this application can be used by the people of age group of more than 18 years, who are ready to make their own decision that they want to be a part and be a donor or not. Any citizen of our country who has access to the internet can use this application, irrespective of their location. While referring to the other applications on organ donation there was a drawback that they were providing the details of the donor and recipient to each other which can result in dangerous crimes like killing for the need of an organ. This application aims at linking the donors or wanting to be donors to the seekers without telling the details of each other just by passing the urgent message requests from recipients to the donors. The donors will register on the site with their information and then fill a NOTTO form to receive their donor card. They can also view myth buster section to clear misunderstanding about organ donation. A dedicated FAQ section is also provided to clear the doubts of the donors/receivers.
